    Load in the JavaScript file. Not that this is at the end of the body for a few reasons
    1. The JS file is downloaded and executed after the above HTML is parsed and created
       in the DOM which means we can safely access the elements in the DOM via JS.
       If this JS file was instead in the head tag, the browser would download and execute the JS file before the
       HTML elements in the body have been parsed and created in the DOM (remember the
       browser reads the HTML from top to bottom). This means calls to document.querySelector()
       in JS would fail to find any elements as they have not been created in the DOM yet.

    2. When the browser encounters a script tag, it will pause parsing of the HTML so it can
       download and execute the JS file. This can cause a delay in the webpage showing to the user.
       If it takes half a second or a second to download and parse the JS file the user will see a blank
       page for half a second. This might not seem like much of a delay but even the smallest
       of delays can impact the user experience.

    Note: There are newer ways to achieve the same functionality as placing the script
    tag at the end of the body such as using the defer attribute on the script tag. There
    is also an async tag.
