    <h1>A Blog Post</h1>

    <p>Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design and development! In this exercise,
       we'll play around with some of the most common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making 
       a nice blog post-like web page</p>

    <h2>All About Typography</h2>
      
    <p class="headline">Headlines like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the reader's attention, to give them a summary, intro or other important information in a web page. You can use
        <code>text-transform:uppercase</code> to make a whole body of text uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!

    <p>Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which you should do sparingly) - it's time to chat more about other components of typography. You'll notice that we choose
        a nice serif font for our headings and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is intentional! Serif font faces are generally considered pretty inacessible as a body text style, since
        at smaller sizes its much more difficult to visually differentiate the characters from one another. At large font sizes, such as those seen in most headings, serif fonts are considered fine,
        since the larger style makes it easier to see where serif characters start and where they end.</p>
     
     <p>But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might see in web pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the <code>blockquote</code> element and style
        it accordingly so it stands out a bit as a non-body text quote.</p>

    <blockquote class="quote">"This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it some nice styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience Design, where we take special care to 
        implement our web page in a way that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers. Differentiating our different typography components visually makes information much more organised and 
        easier to digest for our users" <cite> - A Wise Person</cite></blockquote>

    <h3>A New Section</h3>

    <p>And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a <code>hr</code> element (a 'horizontal rule'
       or a divider) and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun...?</p>

    <p>Notice as well that when we entered in the <code>h3</code> content, it was all lowercase, but now its in a nice Title
       Case where the first letter of each word is capitalised. We did that with CSS! Using <code>text-transform:capitalise;</code>
       we can implemenet title cased content</p>

    <h3>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
    
    <h4><code>px</code> (pixels)</h4>

    <p>Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default
       the browser sets the root font size to <code>16px</code> but you can change the font 
       size in the <code>>body</code> element or any other HTML element by setting <code>font-size</code> to any number
       of <code>px</code>.</p>
    
    <h4><code>em</code></h4>

    <p><code>em</code> units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the <code>body</code>
       element is <code>16px</code> and a nested <code>div</code> element's font size is set to <code>1.5em</code>, the browswer
       will multiply 16px x 1.5, resulting in <code>24px</code> font in the div</p>

    <h4><code>rem</code> (root em)</h4>

    <p>Root <code>em</code> untis are similar to <code>em</code> but they are relative to the root font size 
       instead of the parent element of whatever is being styled. For example, if the 
       root font size (the font size of the <code>body</code> element) is set to 16px and we have a <code>p</code> element
       nested many layers down with a font-size set to <code>2rem</code>, that paragrapgh will have 32px font.
       If the body font size changes, this paragraph will also change accordingly.</p>
    
    <h4>Which One Do I Use?</h4>

    <p>Great question! Generally, people try to stick to using <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> over <code>px</code>, since they make responsive typography that scales up and down across different device widths much easier. 
        Using <code>px</code> for your font sizes is not as dynamic, and you may find that writing media queries to update all the various element font sizes in pixels at different screen widths is not the most 
        scalable approach to typography.</p>

    <p>
        Between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code>, <code>rem</code> has a nice advantage of all elements being relative to one single root font value, where nested elements with parent/child font size dependencies can still be 
        hard to manage with <code>em</code> units. When writing responsive styles, <code>rem</code> allows you to simply update the root font size at different screen sizes and all elements using <code>rem</code> units will adjust 
        themselves accordingly creating a super easy-to-manage typography size system.</p>
    
    
    <p>In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but it's always important to understand the drawbacks of writing styles that may not be responsive or dynamic.</p>
